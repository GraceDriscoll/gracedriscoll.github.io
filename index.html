                            <p>I have worked and volunteered with PWP since May of 2018, only stopping last March due to the pandemic and lack of
                                in-person class opportunities. Throughout my time there, I assisted intrsuctors during fitness classes, ensured
                                particpant safety, and encouraged overall motivation. I often spent time adjusting exercises to cater to those
                                on various levels of the ability spectrum. Another responsibility of mine was setting up/taking down, and facilitating
                                safe equipment use. I was also tasked with keeping first aid kits and emergency contact lists updated. PWP
                                offers classes for a variety of Parkinson progression severity, so it is important to tailer each exercise so
                                that it can be optimized for each individual's current functionality. It has been a joy to be a part of this
                                organization, I have met many wonderful people, and I look forward to getting involved again in the near future.

                            <p>This opportunity arose through a Care & Prevention of Athletic Injuries course that I took at UVIC, which turned out to be an amazing experience. During this semester I was on the  sideline supervising the first aid and emergency response for a Women's premier soccer team. I used my athletic taping techniques and overall first aid knowledge to manage various acute and chronic conditions. I attended both practices and games. It was during this class that I discovered I do not have the stomach for a career as an athletic trainer!</p>

                            <p> Throughout my degree so far, there have been many labs and group projects, which I think are two key aspects that
                                set this program apart from others. Because of all of this lab exposure and team work, I have gained hands-on
                                experience in many fields, and I feel more comfortable asking questions, jumping into situations where I think I can
                                be of help, while also acknowledging when to take a back seat and let others take the lead. Below are some courses that I
                                have taken (or are currently taking), that have helped shape my academic experience at UVIC.

                                <p> These courses focused on the interplay between anatomical structure and function, as well as an in depth analyzation of
                                    all systems (muscular, neural, integument, skeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, renal, endocrine,
                                    lymphatic, and reproductive). The functional anatomy class included a trip to the cadaver lab in the medical
                                    sciences building at the UVIC campus, where we could see the structures that we had learned so much about perform their functions right in front of us. It was an incredible experience to (with gloved-hands) actually feel the surface of a tendon, ligament, muscle, skin, etc. Throughout our time in this lab, we moved between various stations, each with a UBC medical student with a particular system/section of a cadaver uncovered,
                                    which they spoke about at length. It was amazing and overwhelming. The attached paper was a group assignment for the functional anatomy course that involved the assessment of injury, as well as suggestions for stretching and strengthening to hopefully allow for pain-free movement and prevention of further injury.

                                <p>These courses were some of the toughest of my degree (with heavy memorization of human skeletal remains), but they
                                    were also some of the most fascinating. There was emphasis on joints, bone types, upper limb, shoulder girdle, sternum &
                                    ribs, healing of fractures, vertebrae, histology, pelvis, lower limb, skull, and teeth. Each section was
                                    explored in depth in lecture, and was solidified with many hours spent in the lab, studying real human remains. The
                                    forensic course emphasized the numerous ways in which bones can be effected by various forms of trauma, and how to identify them. We explored topics including:
                                    animal chewing/gnawing, biomechanics of bone trauma, timing of bone trauma, fractures, burial of bones, blunt
                                    trauma, polytrauma, total disintegration, reassembling unidentified skeletons, commingling of remains, surgical
                                    and dental hardware, skull fractures, facial fractures, spinal fractures, cerical spine injuries, sharp trauma,
                                    burning and cremation, ballistics, battered child syndrome, children's fractures, and red flag injuries for
                                    child abuse. Additionally, there was a presentation given by Jonathan Sheldan and Bruce Kennedy, on applying forensic
                                    osteology from a policing perspective. They focused on investigation players, toxicology, police, detectives,
                                    forensic entomology, foresnic anthropology, forensic odontology, coroners, and crown/defense.</p>

                                    and heart rate measurements, as well as how each of the aforementioned systems change during exercise, during aerobic
                                    and anaerobic metabolism, with changes in diet, and with various diseases.

                                <p> This course focused on inclusive physical activity and overcoming barriers, intellectual disability and
                                    universal design, a functional approach to modifying movement (FAMME model), movement skills and concepts,

                                    camps. This course highlighted the importance of using "person-first" terminology, ensuring to refer to someone as an "individual
                                    with a disability", instead of saying "disabled person". This language is crucial in the effort to push the narrative
                                    forward that individuals are not defined by their condition; instead, they are human beings just like everyone else. The final
                                    project for this course was compiling a Staff Training Manual for a fictional recreation facility, and ensuring
                                    elements of universal design and inclusivity were at the forefront. My manual is attached below.</p>

                        <div>
                        <p> Organization is one of my strongest areas. Since as far back as I can remember, I have always had a planner in which I keep track of daily life events (school, work, volunteering, hobbies, social events, health, exercise, finances, etc.). I feel as though I can live a less stressful life if I know that my responsibilities are written down and I have a daily breakdown of the goals I need to achieve. I was a secretary for an environmental and social action group (KFESA--Kids for Environmental and Social Action) when I was younger, so taking notes and distributing them in an effective manner was a task that I grew comfortable with. Additionally, being in the kinesiology program and managing 5 classes per term, I have been forced to multitask and am constantly juggling various projects all at once, and it has all been made much easier with great attention to organizational efforts. </p> </div>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Team Work</div>
                    <p> I have had lots of experience working with others to create group projects, including presentations, poster boards, scientific papers, and much more. It has been a skill that I have used in almost every course at UVIC, and has led to the development of some years-long friendships. I have also been involved in sports and dance my entire life, which has also contributed to my comfortability with group work. The ability to collaborate with peers, and function in a give-and-take environment is essential to moving forward in a professional setting. It is a balance between sharing your own ideas, while listening and honoring other opinions. Being able to successfully navigate a group setting (both at school and at work) will translate to greater success in other areas of life. </p> 
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Continuous Learning</div>
                    <p> I have had a passion for learning since I was very young. I am the youngest of 4 kids (3 older brothers), so I have always been striving to keep up with them--both on the soccer field and on the books. I enjoy reading in my free time and learning new things to discuss with friends. For these reasons, even though my post-undergraduate plans are not 100% set in stone, I am sure that wherever I go, I will continue to learn. </p>

                            Melanie Kareem was a middle eastern belly dance teacher of mine from when I was 3 years old until my family moved to Canada in 2012 when I was 14. We got to wear beautiful costumes, learn choreography for group dances, create our own dances, perform in showcases in front of live drummers for large audiences, all while creating strong friendships and developing confidence as women of all ages in a safe and inclusive environment. I have since performed with the Melanie Kareem Middle Eastern Dance School at a local festival called Topanga Days. A link of the video is attached here (my choreography is from minute 37:00 to 39:50), along with a reference letter from Melanie.

                            Rob Remedi facilitated my 7 consecutive years of outdoor primitive skills classes in southern California (I lived in a small town called Topanga from birth to 14 years old). During these outdoor classes I learned many useful skills including: tracking, camouflage, foraging, building shelter, and more. Rob was a huge inspiration of mine for many years, and we are still in touch. An email from Rob is attached below.

                            Suzanne Buckner taught me 6 consecutive years of American Sign Language. She introduced me to the Deaf community and taught not only the signs to communitcate, but also the subleties of Deaf interaction, where to look when communicating with other people, how to navigate a room of Deaf people, how to get their attention politely, among other important social actions. A description of each course along with an email from Suzanne are attached below.

                    <p>Apart from being occupied by 5 courses at UVIC, I enjoy most of my time spent outdoors (especially in the summer). I love hiking, ballet, soccer, disc golf, going to the beach, camping, and most recently, pickleball (I have been told that it's an "old-person game"...I think it's an all-person game!).</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">When I am indoors, I enjoy reading, watching comedies or The Office bloopers, cooking (and eating), caring for my plants, listening to/discovering music, and playing crib with my boyfriend Ben (wow, maybe I am turning into an old timer!).</p>
