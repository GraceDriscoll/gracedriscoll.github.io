                            <p>I have worked and volunteered with PWP since May of 2018, stopping last March due to the pandemic and lack of in-person class opportunities. Throughout my time there, I assisted intrsuctors during fitness classes, ensured particpant safety, and encouraged overall motivation. I often spent time adjusting exercises to cater to those with various levels of mobility. Another responsibility of mine was setting up/taking down, and facilitating safe equipment use. I was also tasked with keeping first aid kits and emergency contact lists updated. PWP offers classes for a variety of Parkinson progression severity, so it is important to tailer each exercise so that it can be optimized for each individual's current functionality. It has been a joy to be a part of this organization, I have met many wonderful people, and I look forward to getting involved again in the near future.</p>

                            <p>This opportunity arose through a Care & Prevention of Athletic Injuries course that I took at UVIC, which turned out to be an amazing experience. During this semester I was supervising sideline first aid and emergency response for a Women's premier soccer team. I used my athletic taping techniques and overall first aid knowledge to manage various acute and chronic conditions. It was during this class that I discovered I do not have the stomach for a career as an athletic trainer!</p>

                            <p> Throughout my degree so far, there have been many labs and group projects, which I think are two key aspects that set this program apart from others. Because of all of this lab exposure and team work, I have gained hands-on experience in many fields, and I feel more comfortable asking questions, jumping into situations where I think I can be of help, and also knowing when to take a back seat and let others take the lead. Below are some courses that I have taken (or are currently taking), that have helped shape my academic experience at UVIC.
                            </p>

                            
                            <div> <b> <p> Human & Functional Anatomy </p> </b> </div>
                                    <p> These courses focused on the interplay between anatomical structure and function, as well as in depth analyzation of all systems (muscular, neural, integument, skeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, renal, endocrine, lymphatic, and reproductive). The functional anatomy class included a trip to the cadaver lab in the medical sciences lab, where we could see the structures in movement right in front of us that we had learned about. It was an amazing experience, we moved between various different stations, each with a UBC medical student with a cadaver, and they spoke about a particular system or section of the body.

                                <div> <b> <p> Human & Forensic Osteology </p> </b> </div>
                                <p>These courses were some of the toughest of my degree, with heavy memorization of human skeletal remains, but they were incredibly interesting. There was emphasis on joints, bone types, upper limb, shoulder girdle, sternum & ribs, healing of fractures, vertebrae, histology, pelvis, lower limb, skull, and teeth. Each section was explored in depth in lecture, and was solidified with many hours spent in the lab with real human remains. The forensic course emphasized how bones are effected by various forms of trauma and how to identify them including: animal chewing/gnawing, biomechanics of bone trauma, timing of bone trauma, fractures, burial of bones, blunt trauma, polytrauma, total disintegration, reassembling unidentified skeletons, commingling of remains, surgical and dental hardware, skull fractures, facial fractures, spinal fractures, cerical spine injuries, sharp trauma, burning and cremation, ballistics, battered child syndrome, children's fractures, and red flag injuries for child abuse. There was also a presentation given by Jonathan Sheldan and Bruce Kennedy, on applying forensic osteology from a policing perspective. They focused on investigation players, toxicology, police, detectives, forensic entomology, foresnic anthropology, forensic odontology, coroners, and crown/defense.</p>
                            
                    
                    <div> <b> <p> Cellular, Systemic & Exercise Physiology </p> </b></div>
                                    <p> These courses studied the functions of all physiological systems, with specific attention to the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, endocrine and muscular systems. We were also taught how to take proper blood pressure and heart rate measurements, as well as how each of the aforementioned systems changes during exercise, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, with diet and various diseases. 
                                        <p> For one physiology courses, I gave a short presentation on strokes, and for another I gave a short presentation on cerebral palsy; the powerpoint presentations for each are attached here.

                                     <div> <b> <p> Nutrition for Exercise & Health, and Concepts & Controversies </p> </b> </div>
                                <p> These courses covered topics such as the history of the human diet, regulation of feeding, metabolism, supplements, vitamins and minerals, macronutrients, dietary choices for health, and nutritional ergogenics for performance.  </p>

                            
                    <div> <b> <p> Measurement and Evaluation in Exercise Science </p> </b>
                                <p> This course taught various laboratory techniques for testing body composition and fitness performance. We focused on validity and reliability, aerobic fitness testing, musculoskeletal (MSK) testing, among other aspects. Some of the lab skills learned include: VO2 max protocol (and safety measures), metabolic cart calibration, Rudolph valve assembly, skin fold measurement, various aerobic and MSK testing protocols, as well as how to properly navigate assessments in terms of soft skills and making the participant comfortable.

                                <p> This course focused on professional conduct as a personal trainer, principles of training, pre-participation health screening, assessing levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviour, prescribing aerobic training programs, prescribing high intensity interval training programs, prescribing programs for MSK health (strength, core, balance & flexibility), prescribing fat loss programs, prescribing exercise programs for clients with stable heart disease/diabetes, and adapted strength and conditioning. This course was paired with a lab in which we could learn the practical applications of the theory taught in lectures. </p>
                           
                            
                            <div> <b> <p> Motor Control, Motor Learning, Motor Development & Physical Maturation </p> </b>
                                <p>  These courses looked at the influences of human movement from the onset to action, and how we grow and mature, continually refining our gross movements into fine, practiced, and smooth movements. We also looked at posture, cerebral organization, as well as how movement disroders change our movement and processing. We also looked at human movement tendencies from birth to old age. We also looked at sensory and motor neurons, postural control, gait, and reflexes, movement planning, and movement control. </p>

                                <p> This course focused on inclusive physical activity and overcoming barriers, intellectual disability and universal design, a functional approach to modifying movement (FAMME model), movement skills and concepts, assessment tools, play/games/sport, health-related fitness and conditioning, and outdoor recreation and summer camps. This course highlighted the importance of using "person-first" terminology, refering to and individual with a disability (instead of saying "disabled person". This language is important in pushing the narrative forward that individuals are not defined by their condition, they are humans just like all of us. The final project for this course was compiling a Staff Training Manual for a fictional recreation facility, and ensuring elements of universal design and inclusivity were at the forefront. </p>

                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Organization</div>
                        <div>
                        <p> I believe that organization is one of my strongest areas. Since as far back as I can remember, I have always had a planner in which I keep track of daily life events (school, work, volunteering, hobbies, social events, health, exercise, finances, etc.). I feel as though I can live a less stressful life if I know that my responsibilities are written down and I have a daily breakdown of the goals I need to achieve. I was a secretary for an environmental and social action group (KFESA--Kids for Environmental and Social Action) when I was younger, so taking notes and distributing them in an effective manner was a task that I grew comfortable with. Being in the kinesiology program and managing 5 classes per term, I have been forced to multitask and am constantly juggling various projects all at once. </p> </div>
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Team Work</div>
                    <p> I have had lots of experience working with others to create group projects, including presentations, poster boards, scientific papers, and much more. It has been a skill that I have used in almost every course at UVIC, and has led to the development of some years-long friendships. I have also been involved in sports and dance my entire life, which has also contributed to my comfortability with group work. The ability to collaborate with peers, and function in a give-and-take environment is essential to moving forward in a professional setting. It is a balance between sharing your own ideas, while listening and honoring other opinions. Being able to successfully navigate a group setting (both at school and at work) will translate to greater success in other areas of life. </p> 
                    <div class="subheading mb-3">Continuous Learning</div>
                    <p> I have had a passion for learning since I was very young. I am the youngest of 4 kids (3 older brothers), so I have always been striving to keep up with them--both on the soccer field and on the books. I enjoy reading in my free time and learning new things to discuss with friends. Even though my post-undergraduate plans are still unknown, I am sure that wherever I go, I will continue to learn. </p>

                            Melanie was a middle eastern belly dance teacher of mine from when I was 3 years old until my family moved to Canada in 2012 when I was 14. We got to wear beautiful costumes, learn choreography for group dances, create our own dances, perform in showcases in front of live drummers for large audiences, all while creating strong friendships and developing confidence as women of all ages in a safe and inclusive environment. I have since performed with the Melanie Kareem Middle Eastern Dance School at a local festival called Topanga Days. A link of the video is attached here.

                            Rob Remedi facilitated my 7 years of outdoor primitive skills classes in southern California (I lived in a small town called Topanga from birth to 14 years old). During these outdoor classes I learned tracking, camouflage, foraging, building shelter, and more. Rob was a huge inspiration of mine for many years, and we are still in touch.

                    <p>Apart from being occupied by 5 courses at UVIC, I enjoy most of my time in the outdoors (especially in the summer). I enjoy hiking, running, ballet, soccer, and most recently, pickleball (I have been told that it's an "old-person game"...I think it's an all-person game!).</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When I am indoors, I enjoy reading, watching comedies or The Office bloopers, cooking (and eating), caring for my plants, listening to/discovering music, and playing crib with my boyfriend Ben (wow, maybe I am turning into an old timer!).</p>
